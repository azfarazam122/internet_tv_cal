3.) “Required Disconnection Information”
AT&T: Must have Pin or Security Answer. Becomes much easier with account number or phone
number associated with the account.
COMCAST: Must have either the account number, the last four of the SS of the client, or the last
4 of the Payment Method on file. Account number only, can be validating piece of info but some
comcast agents don’t know that.
SPECTRUM: Must have the security PIN on the bill which the client doesn’t set but has
assigned to them. Becomes much easier with account number or phone number associated
with the account.
METRONET: We want to make sure new agents know they can’t disco Metronet and the client’s
account is stopped when the equipment is returned. It’s on the Pricing Worksheet but I’ve
probably gotten at least one request from every new agent.
FRONTIER:
DIRECTV: Must have Pin or Security Answer. Becomes much easier with account number or
phone number associated with the account.
I3:
WOW: Must have last four of the SS on file or the pin. We only very occasionally do these but
I’m pretty sure the pin is region specific because not everybody has one.
MEDIACOM: Must have PIN. Becomes much easier with account number or phone number
associated with the account.
HUGHESNET: Account #; last 4 of SSN
CENTURY LINK: Account #; last 4 of SSN
RCN: Must have the last four of the SS. Becomes much easier with account number or phone
number associated with the account.
